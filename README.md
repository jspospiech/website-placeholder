A responsive basic place holder to display on domain janpospiech.com while I work on my prettier portfolio website

Written in HTML, CSS and a sprinke of JS

Fonts are hosted within the project to be deployed on German Servers only in compliance with German general data protection regulations (GDPR / DSGVO)

Live demo will go online at https://www.janpospiech.com once it is ready and will be on display until I find the time to replace this with a fancier portfolio website
